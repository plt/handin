This is the "handin" package for Racket, which provides infrastructure
for automated handin and checking of programs from within DrRacket.
Instructors use this infrastructure to generate a separate,
course-specific ".plt" file (or package) that students install.

Install the official version of the "handin" package with

  raco pkg install handin

or through the "Install Package..." menu item in DrRacket's "File"
menu.

To install this fork, run instead:

  raco pkg install https://github.com/ps-tuebingen/handin.git

After installing, see the "Handin Server" documentation that is added
to the Racket documentation.
